/*
 * The Parallel LCM Driver - Comiple and Usage 
 */
Please make you had enable the Parallel Port in the BIOS.
If you can not "insmod" the Parallel LCM driver, you have
to check the setting in the BIOS first.

Please compile the source code in your Linux.
After compiled, you will have the binary files.
1. plcm_drv.o | plcm_drv.ko (Kernel mode driver module)
2. plcm_test (User mode driver testing program)
3. plcm_cursor_char (User mode driver testing program-for cursor shift & single text update)
4. ppdev_test (User mode linux kernel driver testing program.linux kernel driver is needed
   parport.ko,parport_pc.ko,ppdev.ko need to be loaded before runing this))
5. Test (User mode testing script)
Please run "Test" for testing the parallel LCM functions.

If you want to add the driver module into your Linux.
Please see the "Test" or "Makefile" first.
For exmaple:
You have to run "mknod /dev/plcm_drv c 248 0" to create the device file.

If you have any question or requirement, please contact with the sales. 


Note: insmod: error inserting 'plcm_drv.ko': -1 Input/output error
      please check major device number to whether repeat
